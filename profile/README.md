# EHR Tools

Welcome to **EHR Tools**, an organisation dedicated to developing high-quality, tested tools for electronic health record
research. Our mission is to empower researchers and analysts by providing reliable, open-source solutions to tackle common 
challenges in health data management and analysis.

## Projects

### 1. Codelist Tools (Ongoing Development)
Codelist Tools is our first project, built in **Rust** with **Python bindings** to ensure speed, safety, and interoperability 
with popular data analysis workflows. The tool focuses on simplifying the creation, management, 
and validation of codelists, which are a crucial component in epidemiological studies and health research.

#### Current Status
- **Work in Progress**: While the project is not yet production-ready, we welcome contributions and feedback from the community.
- **Goals**:
  - Streamline codelist creation and management.
  - Support common tasks such as validation and mapping 

#### How to Contribute
We encourage contributions from anyone interested in epidemiology, Rust, or Python development. 
Check out the [Codelist Tools repository](https://github.com/ehrtools/codelist-tools) for detailed guidelines on how to get started.

### 2. Upcoming Projects
In addition to Codelist Tools, we plan to expand into other areas critical to health research:
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Tools for generating realistic, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets to support research and training.
- **Data Management Tools**: Solutions for handling complex health datasets efficiently and reproducibly.

## Documentation
We aim to provide thorough and user-friendly documentation for all our projects. Stay tuned as we build out resources to 
help you get the most from our tools.

## Get Involved
If you're passionate about advancing tools for epidemiology and health research, we'd love to have you join 
us! Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Explore Our Projects**: Check out the repositories under this organization.
2. **Submit Issues**: Found a bug or have an idea? Let us know by submitting an issue on the relevant project repository.
3. **Contribute Code**: Open a pull request with improvements or new features. We are currently using Rust but will need expertise from R and python users. 
4. **Share Feedback**: We're eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions to make our tools even better.

## Vision
EHR Tools strives to be the go-to hub for open-source health research tools. We are just getting started. 
By fostering collaboration and innovation, we aim to enable researchers to unlock the full potential 
of health data in consistent ways so that no one has to reinvent the wheel.
